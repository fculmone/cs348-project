99,Cairo,Egypt,99,76,89,76,103,77,"After experiencing political unrest that lasted more than a decade, Egypt has struggled to bring back its tourism industry, update its infrastructure, and marry its ancient history with future innovation.

Hanoi still shows symbols of past occupation by France and China. It's worth checking out the Old Quarter, a busy district of narrow streets where glimpses of the past come into full focus. First-time visitors to Hanoi might be daunted by all of the sights, sounds, and smells coming from various street food carts, small shops, and motorbike taxis, but this is truly the heart of Vietnam."
97,Guilin,China,110,77,104,83,26,54,"Guilin is one of the most popular destinations in southern China because of its natural wonders. Known for its iconic karsts—jagged hills made of limestone—fans of the ""Star Wars"" franchise might recognize that Guilin was used as a backdrop in ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" to depict the Wookie planet of Kashyyyk.

The most notable attraction is Marrakech's medina, a twisting maze of small stalls; snake charmers; hagglers; Moroccan ""hammams,"" or steam rooms; and artisanal crafts all enclosed within fortified walls. Located nearby is Djemaa El Fna, a famous city square that hosts performers of all kinds—acrobats, storytellers, musical artists, and comedians.

90,Riyadh,Saudi Arabia,47,82,101,62,76,97,"The name of the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh derives from ""rawdah,"" meaning gardens or meadows—which is quite fitting, as the bustling metropolis seems to have sprung out of the surrounding desert land like a flower in just a few decades.

You're less likely to find spring breakers at ""Playa"" compared to other destinations in Mexico—although that time frame and Christmas are most popular for tourists. It's also a port city for cruise ships. But because it offers an average of 340 sunny days a year, there's less of a ""high season"" to avoid."

83,Tallinn,Estonia,67,95,83,94,29,2,"Today, Tallinn's Old City Harbour is a port for cruise ships—among the most popular in the Baltic Sea, serviced by most of the top cruise lines. That means the cruise terminal and surrounding facilities have seen recent modernization and upgrades, including a half-mile-long promenade open to the public—not just cruise passengers, a restaurant with outdoor terraces for sunrise and sunset views, and public art.

As you stroll through this walkable city, stop into one of its bakeries for a slice of cake or Estonian pastry."
82,Heraklion,Crete,82,69,37,99,72,66,"Archaeology fans and those interested in learning about the ancient people who occupied the Greek islands several centuries ago would enjoy taking a trip to Heraklion, the capital of Crete.

Free guided tours of the cemetery are available in Spanish Tuesday through Friday at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. and on weekends and public holidays at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. Following a late-night dinner—think steak and wine, Buenos Aires' most popular commodities—stay out until the following day dancing the night away at one of the city's many clubs, or ""boliches."""
77,Thessaloniki,Greece,85,55,36,100,85,56,"Most of the original city center of Thessaloniki burned down in an epic fire in 1917, but it was rebuilt around Aristotelous Square. But ruins from ancient civilizations remain, as Thessaloniki was once the second-largest city of the Byzantine Empire and one of the capitals of the Roman Empire. The still-operating Vlatadon Monastery is a relic of the Byzantine Empire. Known as the ""City of Saints,"" Thessaloniki was the site of the second Christian church to be established in Europe. You can follow in St. Paul the Apostle's footsteps at the Charitable Brotherhood of Men of Thessaloniki's estate and celebrate his feast day annually on June 29."
76,Bologna,Italy,34,89,65,88,60,39,"Experience northern Italy and the Italian Renaissance in Bologna, home to the world-famous Fountain of Neptune and other romantic sites, including the palaces of Piazza Maggiore. This medieval city is known for its unique cuisine—including rich pasta sauce—locally known as ragù, tortellini in broth, cured meats such as mortadella, and cheeses abound in the gourmet district of Quadrilatero. Wash it all down with a glass of vino produced locally from lesser-known grape varietals like pignoletto, alionza, and rosso Bologna—but not before visiting the main building of Europe's oldest university, the Archiginnasio at the University of Bologna."
75,Verona,Italy,48,65,46,106,57,58,"The entire city of Verona has been deemed a UNESCO World Heritage Site—and not just because it was the setting for Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet""—although you can visit the birthplace of Giulietta Capuleti, supposedly the real-life inspiration for the protagonist. Verona's tourism industry leans into the city's romantic side, offering candlelit dinners, seductive vistas as seen from lookout points like Giardino Giusti, and the observation deck of the Lamberti Tower. Beyond the Roman archaeological sites, one might expect more offbeat tourist attractions, including the Museo Africano (African Museum) and one of Europe's oldest carnivals, Bacanal del Gnoco."
74,Rhodes,Greece,83,84,17,85,71,46,"The largest of Greece's Dodecanese Islands is a must-see destination for visitors looking to relax and take a trip to the past.

72,Doha,Qatar,25,96,42,86,13,100,"Qatar's capital city, Doha, is also its fastest-growing—having gained a lot of notoriety as the host city for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Its Museum of Islamic Art boasts the largest collection of its kind in the world, and its National Museum shares Qatari history and heritage within a modern structure whose design was inspired by the shape of a desert rose. If you'd like to feel the sand between your toes, you can choose between a beach getaway or a Doha desert dune adventure for sandboarding, safaris, and camel rides."
71,Marne-la-Vallee,France,76,47,50,103,36,40,"What put Marne-la-Vallée, France, on the map was the arrival of Disneyland Paris in 1992—but it was originally established in the mid-1960s as part of the country's ""new towns"" effort to create decentralized economic development and take some of the burden off of major city centers like Paris. Today, it's also home to Walt Disney Studios Park, which opened as Disney-MGM Studios Europe in 2002; the Val d'Europe shopping center, which houses the Sea Life Paris Aquarium; and such academic institutions as ParisTech, ESIEE Paris engineering school, and Gustave Eiffel University."

However, there's more to this Yucatan Peninsula gem than seaside resorts. Several Mayan ruins, such as San Miguelito and El Rey, and a museum called the Museo Maya de Cancún, display many artifacts from this ancient civilization. Additionally, there are many water sports and activities that visitors should check out in the daytime, such as snorkeling, kayaking, diving, and kiteboarding."
69,Macau,China,16,39,76,109,1,110,"The tagline ""Wow, Macau!"" is often used to describe this administrative region of China. Macau has no shortage of activities, including casinos with nearly ubiquitous games of baccarat, the world's highest bungee jump facility—Macau Tower, and Macau's famous Senado Square with mosaic floors invoking the styles of Portugal. Additionally, fans of card games and high risks should try playing in one of the casinos well known to the Macau region—gambling and roulette here are less lighthearted fun and more serious."
68,Montreal,Canada,73,91,82,51,24,21,"For an authentic taste of Europe in Canada, visit the church-lined streets of Montréal—home of the North American version of Notre Dame. The basilica is open to the public via ticketed tours daily. All masses in this church are celebrated in French. In fact, the city's official language is French—although, as of 2023, more than half of those in Montréal's province of Québec can speak English. A cultural center on a global scale, music fans will enjoy the Montréal International Jazz Festival, one of the world's largest, which takes place every June to July, and Les Francos de Montréal, which usually happens annually in April.

67,Honolulu,United States,23,54,85,90,66,22,"The capital of the United States' beloved island chain combines work, play, a complex history, and a rich culture.

If you want to explore a fantastic location outside the city, the Wieliczka Salt Mine is a popular destination.

Artists have found inspiration for their craft here, and occasional concerts are performed in the mine."
64,Jerusalem,Israel,102,19,10,108,64,74,"Jerusalem isn't just an important religious site for Judaism, Islam, and Christianity and has become a key historical and political center. Despite recent conflicts surrounding the area, most notably between Israel and Palestine, the city brims with culture and spirituality. The Old City of Jerusalem allows visitors from throughout the world to walk from the Western Wall—the holiest site for Jews, to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre—where Jesus was believed to have been crucified and then resurrected, to the Temple Mount and the Dome of the Rock—where the prophet Muhammad was believed to have ascended to heaven and the third-holiest site for Muslims. For those who stay longer, it is worth taking day trips to the salty Dead Sea, the lowest point in the world, and Yad Vashem, Israel's largest Holocaust memorial and museum. Yad Vashem attempts to explain the tragic events leading up to the Holocaust, provide real-life accounts and artifacts from those who survived and those who didn't, and record and remember as many names of victims as possible."
63,Porto,Portugal,90,62,57,71,39,27,"Porto is another city combining the old and new with beautiful beaches. The Ribeira district, which overlooks the magnificent Rio Douro, has stunning architecture, craft stores, ornate churches, and quaint food spots. Before you leave Porto, try port wine, the dessert-like fortified wine that Portugal is known for, at one of the city's dozens of wine cellars."
62,Edinburgh,Scotland,54,88,56,68,31,30,"Edinburgh Castle reigns supreme over Scotland's capital city—but there are plenty of other ways to explore ""Auld Reekie,"" a Scots nickname meaning Old Smoky that dates back to the 17th century. To view the old city below, climb Calton Hill to the National Monument or the ancient volcano of Arthur's Seat in Holyrood Park.

60,Busan,South Korea,35,87,28,73,40,94,"South Korea's second-largest city, Busan, is home to the famous sandy shore of Haeundae Beach, located just steps away from the city skyline and home to the unique creations of the Haeundae Sand Festival in the summer. For a more colorful experience, visit the Gamcheon Culture Village with its rainbow-colored houses impossibly perched on a steep hillside, earning it the reputation of the Machu Picchu of Busan. There are plenty of places to explore Busan on foot—but perhaps the most thrilling is the Songdo Yonggung Suspension Bridge, which traces the ridge of a seaside cliff and extends over the water to loop around the uninhabited Dongseom Island."
59,Bejing,China,74,64,100,20,30,72,"One of the oldest cities on this list and outliving many dynasties, Beijing has preserved its extensive history while constantly growing and innovating. Even travelers who've never visited China are familiar with its sections of the Great Wall, Forbidden City, and Tiananmen Square—but these destinations are still breathtaking when seen in person. Another site would be a typical Beijing ""hutong""—crisscrossing lanes and alleys built during the Ming and Qing dynasties. These ancient hutongs are at risk of being replaced by modern-era cities and buildings, but they are the best way to glance into a traditional Beijing citizen's life. Visitors must also make it a priority to try Beijing's world-famous Peking duck. This historic Chinese dish is older than many cities, from purveyors like the QuanJuDe Duck House chain, which has operated since 1864."
58,Sapporo,Japan,72,75,54,64,10,51,"The Japanese city of Sapporo may be most famous for its namesake brew—which you can learn about, and even taste, at the Sapporo Beer Museum. But it's also the birthplace of a uniquely Japanese type of ramen—and while there are plenty of restaurants to taste authentic miso ramen soup, Aji no Sanpei is where it was reportedly invented. A feast for the eyes, the Sapporo Snow Festival is a wintertime destination for tourists and locals, who flock there annually to admire elaborate snow sculptures and ice carvings."
57,Antalya,Turkey,68,7,59,66,95,87,"The Turkish resort town of Antalya keeps breaking its own records with its influx of tourists—like the 15.37 million who visited the vacation hotspot from January 2023 to November 2023.

56,Mexico City,Mexico,69,59,90,9,87,65,"Mexico City is so much more than Mexico's national capital—especially with its growing art scene, including the Mexico City Art Week. Wintertime brings eco-tourists to the area to witness the annual migration of monarch butterflies at nearby nature preserves and open spaces, and the autumn sees an influx of tourists for the annual Día de Los Muertos (Day of the Dead) festival and parade, which began in 2016. Venture off the beaten path to the Barrio Chino, a tiny Chinatown that tells a lesser-known history of Chinese immigration to North America and annually celebrates Lunar New Year as a public festival."
55,Valencia,Spain,57,106,39,65,17,18,"Behind Madrid and Barcelona, Spain's third-largest city, Valencia, mixes Mediterranean vibes and flavors, such as its world-famous paella, gothic monuments like La Lonja, The Silk Exchange, and the ultra-modern City of Arts and Sciences—Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències—complex. There's even a legacy of Arab influence from when Muslims conquered the city in A.D. 714—still visible at landmarks like the Admiral's Baths and ruins of Arab-built city walls. Consider scheduling your trip during the Fallas festivities in March to catch all the pyrotechnics, performances, light shows, and puppets called ""ninots"" that get blown up in celebration of St. Joseph."
54,Sao Paulo,Brazil,80,104,32,6,96,52,"With a population of more than 22 million, São Paulo is the fourth-largest city in the world. It's also ground zero for Brazil's favorite sport, soccer—with an art deco-style ""football"" stadium, Estádio do Pacaembu, with its own soccer museum, Museu do Futebol. This Brazilian city is also positioned prominently on the world stage when it comes to theater. Its Theatro Municipal, inspired by the Palais Garnier in Paris, is open for tours when no shows are running. It truly is a global city, too—as it's home to the largest Japanese enclave in the world—outside of Japan—the Liberdade district."
53,Seville,Spain,75,99,14,74,19,11,"Live out your greatest Andalusian fantasies in Seville, Spain, where tourism has boomed in the 2020s. Among the treasures that visitors have discovered are its historic city center, tapas bars, and centuries-old landmarks like the Real Alcázar palace, Catedral de Sevilla—Europe's largest gothic-style building, and La Giralda, a tower from a mosque that was torn down in 1402. Escape the bustle by getting off the sidewalks and streets and heading onto the Guadalquivir River for a boat cruise through the heart of the city, past its many parks and with a view of its many ancient landmarks. Don't forget to take in a performance by flamenco dancers, some of whom perform on street corners as well as in bars and special venues called ""tablaos."""
52,Palma de Mallorca,Spain,50,68,40,84,20,31,"Commonly referred to as ""Palma,"" this Spanish city is known as the ""Pearl of the Mediterranean."" Once walled off to protect the city from invasions, only one stretch of the ramparts that once enclosed it remains—Muralla Ses Voltes, which once served as military barracks, is now part of a cultural center with sprawling exhibition space. Also at the formerly fortified port is the Es Baluard Palma Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, while the uniquely circular Bellver Castle sits high above, at Palma's highest point."

For a scenic way of taking in your surroundings, try the Skyride—North America's largest aerial tramway system."
50,Shenzhen,China,55,15,106,45,32,78,"Shenzhen, the closest Chinese city to Hong Kong, is also one of the country's wealthiest. Shenzhen's rise to prominence started in 1979 when China designated the sleepy border town as the country's first special economic zone. What this city lacks in ancient history, it makes up for in innovation and culture. The Splendid China-Folk Culture Villages is a park with replicas of many famous attractions in China that gives visitors an easy glance into the country's long history. Meanwhile, the Window of the World theme park offers replicas of famous attractions from around the world, from Egypt to Greece to Paris to Cambodia."
49,Budapest,Hungary,60,63,61,46,53,34,"Visitors to Hungary's capital city don't have to go far to fall for the city's charms. Fans of art and culture are drawn to Budapest's numerous architectural styles—Baroque, neo-Gothic, and Art Nouveau, just to name a few—and the newly restored 19th-century-era Hungarian State Opera House, which is open for English-language tours daily. Budapest is also home to more than 100 thermal springs—which means it's a great place to relax at one of its many spas and bathhouses, each building a mini-vacation itself. To complete their trip, visitors should also visit the famous Budapest Pinball Museum, called the Flippermúzeum, and have a night out at one or more of the ruin bars in abandoned buildings and courtyards in the Jewish Quarter."
48,Washington DC, United States,10,83,69,53,68,7,"The United States capital is instantly recognized by its historical monuments—the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial, and the Washington Monument, not to mention the White House. But beyond the National Mall and the Capitol Hill area, ""D.C."" also draws tourists to its many museums within the Smithsonian network, including the National Portrait Gallery and the National Museum of Natural History. Perhaps the most beautiful time of year to visit the District of Columbia is spring, when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. The best place to spot them? The Tidal Basin section of the National Mall."
47,Nice,France,78,43,29,81,45,13,"A sunny, buzzing cultural hub in southeast France, there is no end to activities that people can do in Nice. Located along the French Riviera, Nice is a city of terracotta roofs, excellent dining, beautiful public and private beaches, and museums perfect for history, music, and art buffs. Check out Lascaris Palace to see a fine collection of musical instruments and learn their history enclosed within an architecturally grand palace. End your day watching the sunset from Castle Hill, the highest point in Nice that once housed a former military citadel but is now a must-visit to get the best view of all of Nice."
46,Copenhagen,Denmark,45,79,15,70,49,20,"If you want to explore the best of what the Danish capital has to offer, hop on a bike. Copenhagen's push for greener and healthier living has made it easier to travel on two wheels to any destination within the city's charming and colorful buildings. Perhaps Copenhagen's most interesting attraction that captures its essence is CopenHill, offering visitors the chance to ski, hike, relax, and eat on an artificial slope built atop a waste-to-energy power plant."
45,Guangzhou,China,44,12,102,37,33,79,"Founded in 214 B.C., Guangzhou, China, is a thriving port city whose airport, public transportation, and air quality have all improved significantly over the past two decades. Visitors—including local tourists from elsewhere in the country—are drawn here to trace the history of the Silk Road trade route, see buildings designed by such ""starchitects"" as Zaha Hadid, and take a cruise on the historic 1,243-mile Pearl River. Want to see it all from high above the city? Ascend to the top of the Canton Tower and visit its observation deck at over 1,600 feet."
44,Warsaw,Poland,38,53,87,40,25,32,"Visiting Warsaw is like taking a trip through the city's tumultuous history, as it had gone through many occupations and destructions—most notably in 1944, when Adolf Hitler ordered the city to be virtually leveled after the Warsaw Uprising. Since then, however, Warsaw has been rebuilt and restored, but it still pays homage to its difficult history. Learn about the history of the uprising and the sacrifice of the Polish resistance at the Warsaw Rising Museum, with admission free on Mondays. Visit the POLIN museum, which documents the history of the Jewish community in Poland. Honor the fallen Polish soldiers of World War I and watch the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, active since 1925."
43,Shanghai,China,58,32,96,11,27,92,"One of China's most populated cities, Shanghai is a modern, buzzing financial hub—but it also retains its colonial heritage. The metropolis's location on the Huangpu River allows visitors to see The Bund, Shanghai's impressive cityscape by the waterfront. The 1,614-foot World Financial Center is used for many purposes, including sightseeing, financial operations, fine cuisine, and a hotel."
42,San Francisco, United States,6,81,74,27,81,15,"This Northern California city resting on a peninsula is cool not just in terms of its foggy weather but also in its culture. San Francisco is known for its role in the Gold Rush and the tech industry—but it also offers many other attractions, including Fisherman's Wharf, the oldest Chinatown in the United States, and the former federal prison on Alcatraz Island. Getting around ""Fog City"" could involve climbing steep and sometimes even crooked streets—perhaps via cable car—or crossing the world-famous Golden Gate Bridge. Just beware of earthquakes—like the one that flattened much of the city in 1906."
41,Tel Aviv,Israel,41,20,20,80,69,69,"Tel Aviv, Israel, is a hip, colorful, and modern city that stands out among the more historic, older cities and towns in the country. On the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the west, Tel Aviv is a hub for art, technology, innovation, and wild nightlife. Tel Aviv is also known for being one of the more LGBTQ+-friendly and progressive cities in the Middle East, with a quarter of its population being part of the community, and hosts a massive Pride parade each year that attracts tourists from all around the world to come to see."
40,Brussels,Belgium,62,38,53,50,52,25,"Beer, waffles, chocolate, and comics are just a few reasons to consider visiting Brussels. It's the capital of Belgium and the headquarters of the European Union and European Parliament, but it's not all serious business and politics. Visitors can enjoy a whimsical and relaxed trip around this city by taking a beer tour through the best and oldest pubs and breweries in town, or follow along the comic book route and try to find as many homages to Franco-Belgian comic art painted on the walls as they can. Finally, in between looking at the fine palaces, cathedrals, and historical museums that appear all over this city, take a moment to gawk at the Manneken Pis. This fountain features a statue of a little boy peeing—sometimes in costume—and is one of the most famous sculptures in Brussels."
39,Stockholm,Sweden,42,50,27,82,38,3,"There is no shortage of things to do in Sweden's capital city, which seamlessly marries the past and the future together. A great example of this is the island of Gamla Stan, or Old Town, where Stockholm was first founded. While you're exploring, take a ""fika"" break—a Swedish tradition that encourages relaxing and socializing with friends and colleagues over coffee and treats—before returning to the hustle and grind of everyday life."
38,Abu Dhabi,United Arab Emirates,39,16,35,75,16,85,"The beautiful capital of the United Arab Emirates has grown into a modern and developed metropolis thanks to the country's vast oil reserves. Abu Dhabi offers visitors luxury while paying homage to the region's rich history and Islamic religion. Explore the beautiful deserts and oases of the region; visit the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, one of the largest in the world and the most architecturally impressive mosque in the country; have a taste of authentic Arabian coffee; go sailing on one of Abu Dhabi's waterfronts; and get your hands and arms painted by famed henna artists to experience this magnificent city to the fullest."
37,Venice,Italy,70,10,22,63,56,64,"Venice is truly a place like no other. The city lies upon 118 small islands, all linked together by canals or bridges—which means the way to get around is either by walking or taking a boat. The city's structure also poses unique problems as its delicate foundation has caused the land to start sinking slowly. Additionally, high tides and strong winds could cause the canals to flood—although, in 2023, the city experienced a drought that kept water levels at bay. Visit St. Mark's Basilica, located on St. Mark's Square and dedicated to the patron saint of Venice, to see a beautiful cathedral with beginnings as far back as 1063. Take a water taxi to some of the smaller islands within the city's network to observe the making of items like glass, gondolas, leather, and lace. Finally, gondola rides can be pricey, but they offer amazing, romantic views of Venice and its lesser-known canals and are a rare experience."
36,Kuala Lumpar,Malaysia,15,51,38,16,91,88,"The Malaysian tourist industry has been on the uptick since 2020—and its capital city, Kuala Lumpur, is one of its most popular destinations. In addition to its mixture of British colonial and Asian architecture, standouts of its skyline are the Petronas Twin Towers—the world's tallest twin structures, which pierce the sky with their matching spires. Other impressive skyscrapers include the 50-story concrete Maybank Tower and the KL Tower, whose observation deck offers a stunning view."
35,Miami,United States,9,26,77,44,83,6,"Miami received the most international arrivals of any U.S. gateway, as of a preliminary 2021 report, after a record-breaking 50.6 million passengers passed through its airport that year. This Florida city attracts tourists for its stunning beaches; vibrant arts district, including the Art Basel art fair, which happens in December and brings in large crowds annually; and its distinct Cuban influence, most notably in the neighborhood Little Havana and Calle Ocho, its main street."
34,Las Vegas,United States,30,18,64,49,67,16,"Las Vegas—also known as Sin City—may mainly be known for its Strip, home to numerous casinos such as Caesars Palace and Aria. However, this popular Nevada city can provide an epic getaway for the entire family, with its iconic hotels, spas, faux reproductions of popular world attractions, and the chance to sit behind the wheel of some of the world's most luxurious cars. Don't be surprised if you encounter a celebrity singer or chef—artists like Lady Gaga and Mariah Carey have performed residencies in Las Vegas, and food legends like Bobby Flay, Guy Fieri, and Gordon Ramsay operate restaurants there."
33,Bangkok,Thailand,43,27,31,14,107,91,"Locals actually know Bangkok as Krung Thep—short for Krung Thep Mahanakhon Amon Rattanakosin Mahinthara Ayuthaya Mahadilok Phop Noppharat Ratchathani Burirom Udomratchaniwet Mahasathan Amon Piman Awatan Sathit Sakkathattiya Witsanukam Prasit— the city's official full name. The Thai capital is yet another old city that is learning how to blend its past and its future—preserving magnificent Buddhist temples, where you'll need to dress appropriately; palaces, like The Grand Palace that is open for visits daily; while also building edgier skyscrapers like the MahaNakhon by German architect Ole Scheeren, completed in 2018."
32,Zurich,Switzerland,29,67,34,58,3,19,"While internationally renowned as a global financial center, Zürich is also home to Switzerland's largest art museum, Kunsthaus Zürich, and a world-class succulent collection, located in the greenhouses of Sukkulenten-Sammlung Zürich. For an entirely different kind of superlative, visit the world's largest Lindt chocolate shop in a stunning modern architectural landmark on Lake Zurich—a popular destination in its own right, mainly for warm-weather recreation like boating. In the winter, Zürich provides easy access to the Swiss Alps for a day trip in the snow."
31,Athens,Greece,40,66,4,25,86,63,"Despite being one of the oldest cities on this list, Athens, Greece, saw tremendous growth in tourism between 2019 and 2023. The country's capital, which offers visitors the chance to see some historical landmarks that they may have only seen in their school textbooks, is unique in how it's lived through nearly every form of government and various styles of architecture throughout its long history. Visit Athens' most famous destination, the Acropolis, a fortified hill that holds most of its iconic landmarks—Parthenon, Temple of Athena Nike, the Theater of Dionysus, just to name a few. The nearby Acropolis Museum houses the artifacts recovered from the hill and is also a must-visit, as are the other ruins of temples speckled through Athens. Finally, take a break from history by visiting the neighborhoods of Monastiraki and Psirri, bustling hubs of fantastic food, shopping, and street art."
30,Toronto,Canada,37,60,52,32,22,26,"Unlike many cities on this list, Toronto's charm lies in the fact that it's a major city—the most populous city in Canada, to be exact. It is also the most diverse city, with half of the population born outside of Canada. Famous destinations in this capital city of Canada's province of Ontario include the CN Tower, offering several vantage points of the surrounding city. Additionally, the Hockey Hall of Fame is a must-see for winter sport fans, as it houses the largest hockey collection in the world—including the actual Stanley Cup—and has been inducting hockey legends for nearly 80 years."
29,Florence,Italy,56,17,19,48,63,48,"Florence shows what Italy is all about, as this Tuscan gem is the birthplace of the Renaissance and is home to famous artwork and architecture, not to mention amazing food and gelato. One of the masterpieces is the Florence Cathedral or Duomo di Firenze, whose main building was completed in 1436, with some exterior parts added in the 19th century. The Duomo is a massive and constantly evolving work of art, usually noticed by its white, pink, and green marble facade; its 52 stained-glass windows; and its massive red-tiled cupola, designed by Filippo Brunelleschi. Other amazing artwork can be found in the Uffizi Palace and Gallery, which hosts an impressive collection of Renaissance artwork, including pieces from Da Vinci, Caravaggio, Botticelli, Raphael, and Michaelangelo."
28,Taipei,Taiwan,2,33,55,28,44,83,"The capital of Taiwan is known for a 1,667-foot landmark called Taipei 101. Resembling a bamboo stalk, it has a high-speed elevator that takes visitors to the 89th-floor observation deck in only 37 seconds. Don't stop here; Taipei offers much more than this speedy elevator ride. Try shopping at its night markets; visiting a national park, museum, or temple; or simply sampling its street cuisine. Another exciting thing to do in Taipei is shrimp fishing, where you catch your own food from small artificial pools and then clean it and grill it."
27,Kyoto,Japan,63,44,5,43,7,67,"If you want to experience more of the traditional side of Japan, Kyoto is your place to go. Comprising over 2,000 Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, it's not unusual to see someone praying, meditating, or strolling through the many beautiful Zen gardens within these spiritual structures. Get the whole Kyoto experience by checking out the work of local artisans in the Gion district and by choosing to stay at a ryokan, a traditional Japanese inn."
26,Frankfurt,Germany,20,48,49,36,48,5,"Known as ""the gateway to Europe,"" Frankfurt, Germany, connects many travelers to different parts of Europe through the busiest airport in the country. Visit the old town of Römerberg during the holidays to experience its massive Christmas market. Take a trip to the restored Goethe House, where famous writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was born. Finally, climb up the Main Tower high rise to see Frankfurt's skyline and the Main River, which have been likened to New York City's Manhattan cityscape and waterfront, from the highest observation point."
25,Orlando,United States,19,6,48,39,82,37,"Orlando is theme park central, with Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando, SeaWorld Orlando, and Legoland—all family-friendly favorites, among many other smaller parks. But Orlando doesn't just offer the magic of Disney and Harry Potter. There is also plenty of fine dining, wonderful spas, cool museums, and relaxing parks to explore if you're just trying to enjoy the Florida sunshine. Drive about 60 minutes east from Orlando to check out the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex if you want to pretend to be an astronaut, or travel about 40 miles west of downtown Orlando to Revolution Adventures to engage in some ATV or dune buggy racing through the muddy roads of this adventure park."
24,Melbourne,Australia,49,13,70,34,5,4,"The city center of Melbourne, Australia, and its surrounding suburbs can offer visitors a cool, hipster-like experience, quickly noticeable just by walking down its graffitied, cobblestone streets or through its many flea markets. Melbourne takes two things seriously: coffee and sports. Melbourne has thousands of cafes offering the best quality coffee created in many unique ways—Americans may recognize the now-popular flat white, which has Aussie origins. As for sports, Melbourne is known for cricket, Australian rules football, horse racing, and tennis, just to name a few. The iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground sports stadium, ""The G,"" is a popular destination, especially when the Australian Rules Football League season starts."
23,Istanbul,Turkey,13,25,23,92,98,98,"Istanbul saw a 26% growth in international arrivals in 2023, placing it at the top of Euromonitor's ranking. Most of Turkey's visitors came from Germany, Russia, and Ukraine in 2021—but it's also been attracting the attention of travelers from the Middle East. For a unique Turkish retail experience, the Grand Bazaar is the place to go. It's been around since 1461, so it can be considered the world's oldest shopping center. Take a day to explore the hidden alleys of the bazaar, whose more than 4,000 small businesses offer the opportunity to haggle your way to a deal—and a unique cultural experience."
22,Sydney,Australia,36,2,71,42,6,17,"Among Australia's largest cities, Sydney is a great place to visit for those looking to have a more laid-back vacation. The stunning Sydney Opera House is an architectural feat—and inside, you'll find myriad performances happening each week. The Sydney Harbour Bridge, nicknamed the ""coat hanger,"" is a structural engineering feat that you can experience up close by booking a ""climb"" experience, which provides the best views of the harbor. If you're looking for day trips, the Blue Mountains or Hunter Valley are the way to go. The Blue Mountains offer amazing hiking trails, and it's worth going up to the peak of these rock formations during sunset. The vineyards of Hunter Valley, located north of Sydney, are perfect for wine lovers—and you can even enjoy a glass of wine while traveling in a hot air balloon over the region."
21,Prauge,Czech Republic,33,31,43,21,54,23,"Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, also known as Czechia, saw its tourism grow by 28% in 2023, compared to the previous year, with 5.5 million visitors arriving during the first three quarters of the year. With a bohemian appeal and fairy-tale charms, Prague attracts tourists who want to explore its trademark Prague Castle, the home of many former Czech rulers and presidents; enjoy a famous Czech beer; or explore the colorful and whimsical streets of the Old Town and the Golden Lane, where Czech-Jewish writer Franz Kafka notoriously once wrote."
20,Lisbon,Portugal,61,37,25,23,37,14,"As tourism to Portugal surges, especially from the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the United States, the colorful and architecturally stunning capital city of the southern European country has plenty to offer visitors. Bring comfortable shoes when wandering around Lisbon, as the city is built over seven hills—and navigating its steep and winding roads is not for the faint of heart, despite the beautiful views. Using the city's tram network is a unique and fun way to get around. The most popular tram route is the E28. The 28 trams date back to the 1930s—and their slick designs are the only trams that can navigate through the narrowest Lisbon streets."
19,Los Angeles,United States,3,11,66,19,80,36,"The so-called ""City of Angels"" lures tourists with its mild weather, buzzy nightlife, laid-back vibes, and trademark Santa Monica and Venice beaches. From luxury shopping on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills to taking on the winding hiking trails to the famous Hollywood sign or the Griffith Observatory, everyone can find something to do in Los Angeles. Although many tourists want to check the famous Hollywood Walk of Fame off of their lists, they can also veer off the beaten path by checking out Little Tokyo, the largest Japanese ethnic enclave in the United States, or taking a ride on ""the world's shortest railway,"" Angel's Flight."
18,Vienna,Austria,28,36,41,30,41,8,"Vienna gave rise to such great musical minds as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Joseph Haydn, and Franz Schubert—all of whom helped bring attention to this ""city of music."" The baroque streetscapes, holding various imperial palaces, are remnants of the Habsburg royal dynasty. Additionally, the city's exquisite wine culture and casual but essential coffee house culture are already enough to attract visitors. Don't forget to try a slice of Sachertorte, a chocolate-iced chocolate sponge cake with layers of apricot jam in between, which you can find at its birthplace, the Hotel Sacher."
17,Hong Kong,China,8,23,24,33,8,104,"Tourism to Hong Kong is continually bolstered by its proximity to mainland China—even though relations have been particularly tense since 1997, when Britain relinquished control over the territory. Traditionally known for its vibrant shopping centers, especially the Temple Street Night Market, Hong Kong has been focusing on showing off its natural beauty and culture when city life gets too hectic. Visitors can enjoy beautiful beaches, numerous nature reserves, and hiking trails, and they might even get to glimpse Hong Kong's famous but increasingly rare pink dolphins."
16,Osaka,Japan,46,45,11,18,15,57,"Tourists used to overlook Osaka, Japan, flocking instead to the better-known city of Tokyo, but that is slowly starting to change. Osaka is a vibrant, modern city filled with lights, nature, and many great cuisines. Osaka is known as ""Japan's kitchen"" due to its unique dishes, many Michelin-starred restaurants, and amazing street food carts. Once you've had your fill, don't miss Osaka Castle, built in the 1500s by a former feudal lord and one of the city's most important landmarks, surrounded by cherry blossom trees that burst open every spring."
15,Dublin,Ireland,17,57,2,56,2,9,"Ireland's capital is another place with beautiful, centuries-old cathedrals, castles, and museums. However, the way to get into Dublin's culture is to follow the books and booze. Channel your inner James Joyce or Oscar Wilde by exploring Dublin's numerous quaint bookstores and libraries. Check out Marsh's Library, Ireland's first public library that opened in 1707, or the Trinity College Library, the largest library in the country that contains the ancient Book of Kells. Learn more about Ireland's history by booking tours and drinks at the Guinness Storehouse Factory, the Old Jameson Distillery, and the Irish Whiskey Museum, or chat with one of the locals at one of Dublin's many unique and vintage bars."
14,Seoul,South Korea,22,34,21,7,42,90,"Seoul, South Korea, combines aspects of South Korean culture that don't seem to mesh at first—mountain temples and shrines, ornamental palaces, a booming Korean pop and clothing scene, and futuristic neon-lit city streets. The most popular of the palaces is Changdeokgung, built in 1405 and used well into the 20th century, which is surrounded by beautiful secret gardens."
13,Milan,Italy,27,30,18,17,58,53,"Milan might be known as a modern metropolis and the high-end fashion capital of Italy, but the former capital of the Western Roman Empire is several thousand years old. As in Florence, one of the prettiest buildings is a cathedral—the largest Gothic complex in the world, the Duomo di Milano, which took more than 500 years to complete. However, those who want to check out the commercial life of Milan should visit the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, one of the oldest shopping malls in the world, built in the mid-19th century, whose architecture reflects the marble, mosaic, and glass style of Milan's other buildings."
12,Munich,Germany,12,22,26,38,50,10,"Munich is ideal for anyone who loves exquisite palaces, historic cathedrals, and great-tasting beer. In fact, Munich's main event every year is Oktoberfest, the world's largest two-week beer festival, attracting millions of visitors between late September and early October. Another fun but unexpected activity for the landlocked capital of Bavaria is river surfing on the waves of the artificial Eisbach river, which is enjoyed by thrill-seekers year-round and attracts many spectators."
11,Singapore,Singapore,1,28,3,35,4,99,"Singapore may be the most expensive city in the world to live in. It tied with Zürich in 2023, but the ""Lion City"" is worth a visit for its beautiful and unusual attractions. Take, for example, its Muslim quarter—the Kampong Gelam historic district, and the Gardens by the Bay, where there's always something blooming, no matter what time of year. You can even wrap up your day at the Night Safari zoo, the first nocturnal wildlife park in the world."
10,London,England,11,24,47,1,35,45,"It's hard to know how much Brexit has contributed to the decline in tourism to London since the United Kingdom officially split with the European Union in 2020, as it coincided with international travel restrictions. But as Britain's cultural, economic, and transportation hub, this capital city has seen a steady stream of European tourists since 2022—despite the added paperwork necessary for some to visit after the landmark ""exit."" Some of the most popular attractions include such historic sites as Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, and the U.K. Parliament—but you can get one of the best views of London from a more contemporary attraction, the London Eye, added to the skyline in 2000."
9,Barcelona,Spain,26,40,13,13,23,38,"The sunny capital of the Catalonia region, Barcelona is still the most popular tourist destination in Spain. There are so many activities to do in this city and places to explore that a single short trip may not be enough. Be sure to take some time and visit all of architect Antoni Gaudí's buildings, including the Sagrada Família, Casa Batlló, Casa Milà, and the pavilions at Park Güell. These architectural feats are unique and show the range of Gaudí's style, as well as influence the work of more contemporary architects and designers."
8,New York,United States,7,5,44,8,84,24,"New York City remains the top city destination in the Western Hemisphere, attracting 56.7 million visitors in 2022. While Manhattan may be the heart of the ""Big Apple"" and is known worldwide as a financial, cultural, and diverse center, the island's four surrounding boroughs each have distinct personalities and attractions. For example, Queens is known for being the most diverse county in the world, with at least 160 languages used daily. The borough of Brooklyn is connected to Manhattan by the landmark Brooklyn Bridge; it is home to the country's oldest performing arts center, the Brooklyn Academy of Music; and Coney Island, ""the birthplace of the American amusement park."""
7,Rome,Italy,53,9,8,4,59,41,"The Italian capital is Europe's fifth most visited city and the origin of the great Roman Empire. In addition to a vibrant street life and decadent cuisine, the Eternal City has been a sacred city for 3,000 years. Among the oldest of the famous Roman buildings is the Colosseum, built between A.D. 70-80; the Pantheon, construction starting in A.D.118; and the Arch of Constantine, built in A.D. 315."
6,Berlin,Germany,59,3,16,12,51,12,"Berlin is a resilient city, as its residents work to overcome the German capital's tumultuous history from the past century. An example is the East Side Gallery, a former portion of the Berlin Wall that has now become a street art collection of murals and political drawings. Closer to the famous Brandenburg Gate lie 2,711 concrete slabs that make up the Holocaust Memorial, where visitors are encouraged to process their thoughts and emotions in their own way."
5,Amsterdam,Netherlands,5,8,12,22,43,28,"The Dutch capital has become a fan-favorite due to its charming canals, colorful townhouses, and numerous bike paths. A must-visit site is the Anne Frank House. Visitors can see the annex where Frank wrote her diary and learn about life in hiding. Additionally, the Van Gogh Museum gives tourists a look into the life of 19th-century painter Vincent van Gogh, who was little-known during his actual lifetime but is now one of the most influential artists in history."
4,Tokyo,Japan,18,21,7,3,12,59,"The bright lights of always-bustling Tokyo make the capital the most popular city in Japan, and there are many reasons to keep visiting, no matter the season—from the Cherry Blossom Festival in April to the beautiful light displays in Tokyo Station, Omotesando, Roppongi Hills, and throughout the city in December. Visitors come to marvel at a concert of people moving from one street to the other at Shibuya Crossing. People watch the colorfully dressed cosplayers at Yoyogi Park or relax in the city at ""onsens,"" or hot spring baths. Among the many popular attractions in Tokyo is Kabukiza, the main theater for the Japanese dance of kabuki, an elaborate performance with dramatic sets, outfits, and makeup."
3,Madrid,Spain,21,42,6,5,18,1,"Madrid is a lively—though old—city with an energetic population. Walking down the street, you're likely to see buildings from the 16th century, built during the peak of the Spanish Empire or even earlier. Fans of soccer, aka football or fútbol, would enjoy a tour around Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, the home of the world-famous and prolific Real Madrid team. If you want to escape the crowded city squares, check out the park El Retiro. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is a great place to relax; go for a jog; rent a bike; go for a boat ride on the park's lake in the summer; or even admire Madrid's oldest tree, which has been alive since 1633."
2,Dubai,United Arab Emirates,4,4,9,15,14,70,"This oasis in the desert is home to some of the world's best hotels, shopping, and increasingly good dining and cultural options. These are just some factors that make Dubai the most popular destination in Africa and the Middle East. Check out Ski Dubai, the world's first indoor ski resort, open year-round in the city's warm climate. The gold and spice souks are large bazaars offering precious jewelry and pungent flavors. Of course, the city's also home to Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, at 2,716 feet above the city."
1,Paris,France,24,1,1,2,47,33,"Even travelers who have never been to the City of Lights have heard about its many landmarks and attractions, such as the unmistakable Eiffel Tower, the beautiful and gigantic Musée du Louvre—the most-visited museum in the world, the Arc de Triomphe, and the Notre-Dame Cathedral, which was devastated by fire in 2019 and lost its wooden roof and spire. People worldwide raised money in support, and this famous landmark closed for renovations until reopening in December 2024."
