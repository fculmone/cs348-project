And fortunately, you don't have to be Muslim to visit Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque, as guests of any faith are welcome any weekday except Fridays."
99,Cairo,Egypt,99,76,89,76,103,77,"After experiencing political unrest that lasted more than a decade, Egypt has struggled to bring back its tourism industry, update its infrastructure, and marry its ancient history with future innovation. The Grand Egyptian Museum, which opened for a trial run in October 2024, should help achieve all of those goals. The expansive museum is located within 3 miles of the famous Pyramids of Giza and aims to chronicle life in Egypt under pharaohs."
98,Hanoi,Vietnam,98,103,93,41,90,103,"Seeing Hanoi, Vietnam's capital city, is seeing its unique history, from the first inhabitants over 10,000 years ago to its recovery after the Vietnam War. Hanoi still shows symbols of past occupation by France and China. It's worth checking out the Old Quarter, a busy district of narrow streets where glimpses of the past come into full focus. First-time visitors to Hanoi might be daunted by all of the sights, sounds, and smells coming from various street food carts, small shops, and motorbike taxis, but this is truly the heart of Vietnam."
97,Guilin,China,110,77,104,83,26,54,"Guilin is one of the most popular destinations in southern China because of its natural wonders. Known for its iconic karsts—jagged hills made of limestone—fans of the ""Star Wars"" franchise might recognize that Guilin was used as a backdrop in ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" to depict the Wookie planet of Kashyyyk. A popular tourist attraction is taking a cruise along the beautiful Li River, which offers visitors a view of the formations, various fishing villages, caves, and bamboo fields."
96,Punta Cana,Dominican Republic,93,72,60,96,94,76,"The Dominican Republic's Punta Cana is a dream of an island getaway, with 30 miles of pristine beaches providing access to the crystal-clear waters of both the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. That makes watersports like swimming and scuba diving a top attraction for tourists who stay at one of the city's many all-inclusive resorts. More adventurous types can take a flying leap for an adrenaline rush at Scape Park at Cap Cana. At the same time, those looking for a more relaxing vacation in the Dominican Republic can hit the links at one of Punta Cana's many golf courses."
95,Mecca,Saudi Arabia,79,29,109,92,74,108,"Mecca is the holy city of Islam, drawing millions of people for the annual Hajj, a five-day religious pilgrimage Muslims must take at least once in their lives. Mecca is the birthplace of the prophet Muhammad. The Kaaba, a shrine in the middle of the Great Mosque of Mecca, is the most sacred spot in Mecca, and Muslims face it when praying."
94,Zhuhai,China,88,71,103,87,34,73,"The port city of Zhuhai connects neighboring Macau and Hong Kong with the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge—the longest sea bridge in the world—and has become an important city for China's economy and its environment. Promoting manufacturing, technology, eco-agriculture, and research, Zhuhai has expanded rapidly to become one of China's most important cities for development. Suppose tourists are looking for a thrilling getaway. In that case, they should check out the world's largest indoor theme park, the Chimelong Spaceship at the Chimelong International Ocean Tourist Resort, or the Lionsgate Entertainment World theme park, which combines a virtual reality experience with some of the Los Angeles-based movie studio's famous films."
93,Mugla,Turkey,92,41,81,101,79,86,"The Turkish province of Muğla, along the Aegean Sea, is known for its many ruins and outdoor activities. Take a boat to Gemiler Island, featuring Byzantine-era remnants of churches and tombs. Check out what's left of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, which finished construction in 350 B.C. Finally, visit Kayakӧy, a ghost town dating back to 1923 that still has evidence of a time when Muslims and Christians lived there in harmony."
92,Vilnius,Lithuania,51,98,86,102,55,29,"Visit Lithuania's capital city for the chance to explore a history dating back to the 14th century—which you can learn all about at the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, a museum located in a Baroque-style palace that was built in the 17th century for top members of royalty at the time. Vilnius is also known for its Gothic architecture, which can be explored at several churches, such as St. Anne's and the neoclassical-style Vilnius Cathedral, built on the site of worship of the Lithuanian thunder god Perkūnas."
91,Marrakech,Morocco,109,92,45,72,61,96,"In Marrakech, visitors can enjoy its beautiful gardens, contemporary architecture, and local souks and markets' exotic foods and spices. The most notable attraction is Marrakech's medina, a twisting maze of small stalls; snake charmers; hagglers; Moroccan ""hammams,"" or steam rooms; and artisanal crafts all enclosed within fortified walls. Located nearby is Djemaa El Fna, a famous city square that hosts performers of all kinds—acrobats, storytellers, musical artists, and comedians. Many of these ancient heritage sites were spared by a deadly earthquake that rocked the city in September 2023—but some rubble from other structures that were damaged in the temblor may still remain."
90,Riyadh,Saudi Arabia,47,82,101,62,76,97,"The name of the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh derives from ""rawdah,"" meaning gardens or meadows—which is quite fitting, as the bustling metropolis seems to have sprung out of the surrounding desert land like a flower in just a few decades. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been working to deemphasize its conservative and religious reputation, making its capital a first-class destination for business and leisure travelers worldwide. To view the city from up high and experience fine dining, visitors can make a reservation at The Globe, located near the top of the skyscraper that houses the Mandarin Oriental hotel. The restaurant is housed in a massive golden glass sphere and provides the most stunning 360-degree views of Riyadh, especially at sunset."
89,Tbilisi,Georgia,100,90,80,59,70,55,"One of Europe's oldest capital cities, Tbilisi provides tourist-friendly access to the country of Georgia—formerly part of the Soviet Union but now an independent state, located at the nexus of Eastern Europe and Asia. Taste all those influences together by visiting any of Tbilisi's wineries, vineyards, and wine cellars—a perfect accompaniment to the gastronomical delights of the city's annual summertime cheese festival. That's just one of many palate-pleasing festivals emerging in this tasty destination, where street food is growing in popularity and availability. For a truly authentic experience, go for a scrub-down at one of Tbilisi's ancient sulfur baths."
88,Santiago,Chile,65,109,84,57,65,60,"Journey to the heart of Chile by visiting its capital city, Santiago, nestled in a valley of the Andes Mountains. It's a bustling city escape—with about a third of Chile's population located within its boundaries—meaning there's plenty to do. Visit Latin America's tallest building, Sky Costanera, and tour the museums and other historic landmarks around the town square, Plaza de Armas, which dates back to the 16th century.

86,Playa del Carmen,Mexico,97,73,98,52,77,47,"Playa del Carmen is a resort town that offers a shoreline with access to the Caribbean—less popular than Cancún, but with equal access to aquatic activities like diving incredible coral reefs. A former fishing village, Playa del Carmen is now home to the annual Riviera Maya Jazz Festival and a stretch of modern eateries, bars, and boutiques along La Quinta Avenida. You're less likely to find spring breakers at ""Playa"" compared to other destinations in Mexico—although that time frame and Christmas are most popular for tourists. It's also a port city for cruise ships. But because it offers an average of 340 sunny days a year, there's less of a ""high season"" to avoid."
85,Ho Chi Minh City,Vietnam,77,85,95,26,93,107,"What was once the romantic city of Saigon, Ho Chi Minh City is now a vibrant urban hub filled with both ancient temples and modern skyscrapers. It features French colonial landmarks, such as Vietnam's own Notre-Dame Cathedral, currently being restored until 2027, mixed with ancient Vietnamese traditions and places, such as the bustling Bến Thành Market. The moving War Remnants Museum is a must-visit, as it tells the story of the Vietnam War from the locals' point of view."
84,Pattaya,Thailand,71,49,68,79,106,80,"The eastern Thai city of Pattaya, about two hours away from Thailand's capital, Bangkok, is known for its beaches and resort hotels, earning the nickname ""the Las Vegas of Thailand."" What was once a sleepy fishing village is now home to a lively nightlife and overcrowded streets. Paying homage to Thailand's more religious side, the Wat Khao Phra Bat temple is also a popular attraction, as it's home to a 59-foot golden Buddha."
83,Tallinn,Estonia,67,95,83,94,29,2,"Today, Tallinn's Old City Harbour is a port for cruise ships—among the most popular in the Baltic Sea, serviced by most of the top cruise lines. That means the cruise terminal and surrounding facilities have seen recent modernization and upgrades, including a half-mile-long promenade open to the public—not just cruise passengers, a restaurant with outdoor terraces for sunrise and sunset views, and public art.

As you stroll through this walkable city, stop into one of its bakeries for a slice of cake or Estonian pastry."
82,Heraklion,Crete,82,69,37,99,72,66,"Archaeology fans and those interested in learning about the ancient people who occupied the Greek islands several centuries ago would enjoy taking a trip to Heraklion, the capital of Crete. The most popular destination is Knossos, a well-preserved and restored Minoan palace with a history that can be traced back to 1900 B.C. Another grand sight is the Koules fortress, built by the Venetians during the 16th century, which contains two floors, 26 rooms, and impressively thick walls. Climbing to the top of the fortress offers impressive views of the island."
81,Delhi,India,81,97,62,24,108,106,"India's capital city of Delhi has seen growth in its tourism industry due to an increased focus on health and wellness, with a growing number of yoga retreats and ayurveda practices, in addition to providing continued luxury services for visitors.

79,Lima,Peru,96,80,30,77,89,62,"Peru's capital has been underrated compared to other notable spots in South America. The City of Kings perfectly blends history, nature, nightlife, and culture. Stop by the Miraflores district, an upscale neighborhood in Lima, where you can paraglide over the Peruvian coast, enjoy a bike ride overlooking the Pacific Ocean, party all night in one of the many Miraflores clubs and bars, and explore the different food and shop vendors among the many protected stray cats in Kennedy Park."
78,Buenos Aires,Argentina,86,110,63,31,99,50,"Buenos Aires is like no other city—the birthplace of the sensual tango takes the best of both Europe and Latin America to bring travelers a unique food, dance, nightlife, and architectural experience. Attractions include the historically famous Café Tortoni, open since 1858, and the expansive Recoleta cemetery, where Argentina's rich, famous, and politically important figures are buried.

77,Thessaloniki,Greece,85,55,36,100,85,56,"Most of the original city center of Thessaloniki burned down in an epic fire in 1917, but it was rebuilt around Aristotelous Square. But ruins from ancient civilizations remain, as Thessaloniki was once the second-largest city of the Byzantine Empire and one of the capitals of the Roman Empire. The still-operating Vlatadon Monastery is a relic of the Byzantine Empire. Known as the ""City of Saints,"" Thessaloniki was the site of the second Christian church to be established in Europe. You can follow in St. Paul the Apostle's footsteps at the Charitable Brotherhood of Men of Thessaloniki's estate and celebrate his feast day annually on June 29."
76,Bologna,Italy,34,89,65,88,60,39,"Experience northern Italy and the Italian Renaissance in Bologna, home to the world-famous Fountain of Neptune and other romantic sites, including the palaces of Piazza Maggiore. This medieval city is known for its unique cuisine—including rich pasta sauce—locally known as ragù, tortellini in broth, cured meats such as mortadella, and cheeses abound in the gourmet district of Quadrilatero. Wash it all down with a glass of vino produced locally from lesser-known grape varietals like pignoletto, alionza, and rosso Bologna—but not before visiting the main building of Europe's oldest university, the Archiginnasio at the University of Bologna."
75,Verona,Italy,48,65,46,106,57,58,"The entire city of Verona has been deemed a UNESCO World Heritage Site—and not just because it was the setting for Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet""—although you can visit the birthplace of Giulietta Capuleti, supposedly the real-life inspiration for the protagonist. Verona's tourism industry leans into the city's romantic side, offering candlelit dinners, seductive vistas as seen from lookout points like Giardino Giusti, and the observation deck of the Lamberti Tower. Beyond the Roman archaeological sites, one might expect more offbeat tourist attractions, including the Museo Africano (African Museum) and one of Europe's oldest carnivals, Bacanal del Gnoco."
74,Rhodes,Greece,83,84,17,85,71,46,"The largest of Greece's Dodecanese Islands is a must-see destination for visitors looking to relax and take a trip to the past. Founded in 408 B.C., the Old Town of Rhodes features medieval walls, cobblestone streets, and the restored Palace of the Grand Master that will transport you to the 14th century. Medieval and historical themes are also present throughout the rest of the island and seamlessly combine with modern attractions and amenities, like the new wing of the Museum of Modern Greek Art, to bring you a well-rounded vacation."
73,Sharjah,United Arab Emirates,14,58,99,91,9,84,"Amid Sharjah's imposing fortresses and ornate mosques, you can learn about Islam at the Museum of Islamic Civilization and Holy Quran Academy, which feature unique artifacts and stunning architecture. Since the debut of its Sharjah Biennial 30 years ago, this United Arab Emirates city has also become an art lovers' destination, with the 16th edition taking place from February through June 2025. But no matter when you arrive, you can take in beauty and creativity at the Sharjah Art Museum and Sharjah Art Foundation's permanent interactive exhibit, ""Rain Room."""
72,Doha,Qatar,25,96,42,86,13,100,"Qatar's capital city, Doha, is also its fastest-growing—having gained a lot of notoriety as the host city for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Its Museum of Islamic Art boasts the largest collection of its kind in the world, and its National Museum shares Qatari history and heritage within a modern structure whose design was inspired by the shape of a desert rose. If you'd like to feel the sand between your toes, you can choose between a beach getaway or a Doha desert dune adventure for sandboarding, safaris, and camel rides."
71,Marne-la-Vallee,France,76,47,50,103,36,40,"What put Marne-la-Vallée, France, on the map was the arrival of Disneyland Paris in 1992—but it was originally established in the mid-1960s as part of the country's ""new towns"" effort to create decentralized economic development and take some of the burden off of major city centers like Paris. Today, it's also home to Walt Disney Studios Park, which opened as Disney-MGM Studios Europe in 2002; the Val d'Europe shopping center, which houses the Sea Life Paris Aquarium; and such academic institutions as ParisTech, ESIEE Paris engineering school, and Gustave Eiffel University."
