30,Toronto,Canada,37,60,52,32,22,26,"Unlike many cities on this list, Toronto's charm lies in the fact that it's a major city—the most populous city in Canada, to be exact. It is also the most diverse city, with half of the population born outside of Canada. Famous destinations in this capital city of Canada's province of Ontario include the CN Tower, offering several vantage points of the surrounding city. Additionally, the Hockey Hall of Fame is a must-see for winter sport fans, as it houses the largest hockey collection in the world—including the actual Stanley Cup—and has been inducting hockey legends for nearly 80 years."
51,Vancouver,Canada,31,86,58,67,11,35,"This British Columbian gem is a must-see when visiting Canada. With the Pacific Ocean, multiple large parks and forests, and three major mountains—all easily accessible, visitors can hike, jog, climb, play, and explore to their hearts' content. Vancouver has also played a large role in both film and television: The city has provided the setting for productions such as the "Twilight" saga, the "Deadpool" movies, "Elf," "Night at the Museum," "Riverdale," "Battlestar Galactica," and "Bates Motel," just to name a few. For a scenic way of taking in your surroundings, try the Skyride—North America's largest aerial tramway system."
68,Montreal,Canada,73,91,82,51,24,21,"For an authentic taste of Europe in Canada, visit the church-lined streets of Montréal—home of the North American version of Notre Dame. The basilica is open to the public via ticketed tours daily. All masses in this church are celebrated in French. In fact, the city's official language is French—although, as of 2023, more than half of those in Montréal's province of Québec can speak English. A cultural center on a global scale, music fans will enjoy the Montréal International Jazz Festival, one of the world's largest, which takes place every June to July, and Les Francos de Montréal, which usually happens annually in April. The Just for Laughs comedy festival, held yearly in July, features headliners from around the world telling jokes in both languages. While you're there, try ordering in French at one of the many brasseries in Old Montréal and dancing to European EDM at the New City Gas complex."
96,"Punta Cana","Dominican Republic",93,72,60,96,94,76,"The Dominican Republic's Punta Cana is a dream of an island getaway, with 30 miles of pristine beaches providing access to the crystal-clear waters of both the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. That makes watersports like swimming and scuba diving a top attraction for tourists who stay at one of the city's many all-inclusive resorts. More adventurous types can take a flying leap for an adrenaline rush at Scape Park at Cap Cana. At the same time, those looking for a more relaxing vacation in the Dominican Republic can hit the links at one of Punta Cana's many golf courses."
