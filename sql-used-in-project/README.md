This is the sql that is currently used in the project. It does not nessecarily mean that these queries or tables will be in the final project or that any other sql queries from the milestones won't.
It just represents what is currently being used in the project.

Also, I renammed the database to be cs348_project_db just so we don't go into the presentation with a database named test_database
